Temperature Conversion

Celsius to Fahrenheit: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
Fahrenheit to Celsius: °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
Celsius to Kelvin: K = °C + 273.15
Kelvin to Celsius: °C = K - 273.15
Fahrenheit to Kelvin: K = (°F - 32) × 5/9 + 273.15
Kelvin to Fahrenheit: °F = (K - 273.15) × 9/5 + 32

Length Conversion

1 kilometer = 1000 meters
1 mile = 1609.344 meters
1 yard = 0.9144 meters
1 foot = 0.3048 meters

To convert between units, multiply the value by the conversion factor:

meters to kilometers: km = m ÷ 1000
meters to miles: mi = m ÷ 1609.344
meters to yards: yd = m ÷ 0.9144
meters to feet: ft = m ÷ 0.3048

For reverse conversions, multiply instead of divide.
Time Conversion

1 minute = 60 seconds
1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds
1 day = 24 hours = 1440 minutes = 86400 seconds

To convert:

seconds to minutes: min = sec ÷ 60
seconds to hours: hr = sec ÷ 3600
seconds to days: days = sec ÷ 86400
minutes to hours: hr = min ÷ 60
minutes to days: days = min ÷ 1440
hours to days: days = hr ÷ 24

For reverse conversions, multiply instead of divide.
Volume Conversion

1 liter = 1000 milliliters
1 cup (US) ≈ 236.588 milliliters
1 pint (US) = 2 cups ≈ 473.176 milliliters
1 gallon (US) = 8 pints ≈ 3.78541 liters

To convert:

milliliters to liters: L = mL ÷ 1000
milliliters to cups: cups = mL ÷ 236.588
milliliters to pints: pints = mL ÷ 473.176
milliliters to gallons: gallons = mL ÷ 3785.41
